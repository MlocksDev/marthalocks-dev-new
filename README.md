## Install Dependencies

**1. Check if you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which comes bundled with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), a JavaScript package manager):**

```bash
$ node -v
```

```bash
$ npm -v
```

**2. In the _project root directory_ install all the dependencies and libs:**

```bash
$ npm install
```

**3. Run the following command:**

```bash
$ npm run start
```

**4. And then access [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) on your browser.**

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
